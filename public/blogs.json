Well, kind of.[/first para][second para]We haven’t cracked the code on how to live forever, or discovered how to bring someone back to biological life. Instead, it has become much easier and more common to “resurrect” the dead by creating lifelike artificial intelligence (AI) avatars of them.[/second para][third para]Thanks to advancements in generative AI, users can speak with “ghostbots” that mimic people who have passed away. The practice of conversing with a posthumous representation of a dead person is growing in popularity.[/third para][fourth para]However, experts warn of the emotional, legal, and ethical challenges. Ghostbots, though technologically impressive, can stall the grieving process, erode reality, and create moral dilemmas regarding consent and digital legacy.[/fourth para][fifth para]Despite the promise of AI, society remains hesitant. The technology evolves faster than our ability to adapt, raising profound questions about life, death, and the boundaries between the digital and the real.[/fifth para]",
